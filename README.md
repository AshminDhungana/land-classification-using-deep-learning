# land-classification-using-deep-learning
Deep learning project for land classification using satellite imagery with CNN and Vision Transformer models in Keras and PyTorch.


# 🌍 Land Classification Using Deep Learning

This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) to classify geospatial satellite images into different land types such as agricultural and non agricultural.
